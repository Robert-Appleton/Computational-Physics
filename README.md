# Computational-Physics
CSULA PHY 4200
The python notebook in the repository is an assignment for the Physics 4200 computational physics course ate CSULA. It contains some solutions to problems from the book Python with No Fear and also a small project of using plots to depict the different max heights reached by 'rockets' given different forces of thrust and launch angle.

As of 5-11-19: I have uploaded 2 notebooks demonstrating some applications in python. Also, there is a pdf of a paper that describes the content of the two notebooks.
